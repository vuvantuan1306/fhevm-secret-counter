# Day 2 - Interact with SecretCounter on FHEVM

Today, I successfully wrote a Foundry script to call the `.increment()` function of my deployed SecretCounter smart contract on Sepolia testnet.

---

## ðŸš€ Interaction Result:

âœ… Called `.increment()` on Sepolia:

- Tx Hash: `0x9eeda26ce48d4c3a88b5810b112db1408ecb7e84fe384fec7a6a0cb110b83ae5`
- Block: `8808921`
- Gas Used: `43599`
- Fee: `0.000000047447832522 ETH`

## ðŸ’¡ What I learned today:

- How to write interaction scripts with Foundry
- How to call a function on-chain using `--broadcast`
- How to pass `--private-key` and `--rpc-url` securely
- Reinforced understanding of encrypted smart contract logic on FHEVM

---

Next up on Day 3: I will try to retrieve and decrypt the encrypted counter off-chain!
